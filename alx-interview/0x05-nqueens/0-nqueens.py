"""
The N queens puzzle is the challenge of placing N non-attacking queens on an
N×N chessboard. Write a program that solves the N queens problem.

    Usage: nqueens N
        If the user called the program with the wrong number of arguments
        print Usage: nqueens N, followed by a new line, and exit with the
        status 1
    where N must be an integer greater or equal to 4
        If N is not an integer, print N must be a number,
        followed by a new line, and exit with the status 1
        If N is smaller than 4, print N must be at least 4,
        followed by a new line, and exit with the status 1
    The program should print every possible solution to the problem
        One solution per line
        Format: see example
        You don’t have to print the solutions in a specific order
    You are only allowed to import the sys module
